To view the detailed information about a specific token on DYORHub, you have two options

### 🔎 **Search by Contract Address (CA)**

Use the search bar at the top of the page to enter the token’s contract address. This will take you directly to the token's detail page.

### 👆🏻**Click on Token Links**

Wherever a token appears on the homepage or in any list (e.g., trending tokens, recent activity), it is automatically linked to its detail page. Simply click the token name or CA to explore its full analysis.

Each token link throughout the platform is designed to give you quick and seamless access to its full data profile.
