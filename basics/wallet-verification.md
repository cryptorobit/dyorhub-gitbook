# Wallet verification

Connecting your wallet to DYORHub unlocks key features that enhance trust, interactivity, and visibility across the platform.

### üß© Why Connect Your Wallet?

* **Verify Ownership**: Prove that you control a specific wallet address.
* **Access Token-Gated Features**: Some features or content may be limited to token holders or verified contributors.
* **Enable Tipping**: Let others tip your wallet with $DYORHUB if you choose to display it on your public profile.
* **Earn the ‚ÄúVerified Team‚Äù Badge**: If your connected wallet matches a token‚Äôs dev address, you‚Äôll be recognized officially as part of the token team.

### üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### üîí Privacy Controls

This system ensures that your identity is provable and interactions on DYORHub are rooted in transparent, verifiable ownership.
