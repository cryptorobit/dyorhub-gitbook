# Leaderboards

The **Leaderboard** section on DYORHub highlights the most active, accurate, and influential members of the community. It‚Äôs a place to **recognize high performers**, **track your own progress**, and **inspire friendly competition** across multiple contribution categories.

Leaderboards are updated in real time and have been used in the past for **official contests** ‚Äî including events with **SOL prize rewards** for top referrers.

DYORHub leaderboards are divided into several tabs, each measuring a different form of engagement:

### **üîÆ Token Calls**

Ranks users based on the **accuracy and performance** of their token predictions. Metrics include:

* **Hit Rate** (success ratio)
* **Time Accuracy** (closeness to target date)
* **Average Multiplier** (growth multiple of successful calls)
* **Average Market Cap** of tokens predicted

{% hint style="info" %}
Score calculation is based on this formula:

&#x20;`Adjusted Score = (Successful Calls / Total Calls) * log(Total Calls + 1)`

* Success Rate: Measures the accuracy of the user's calls.
* Total Calls: Accounts for the user's activity level.
* log(Total Calls + 1): Applies a logarithmic scale to dampen the effect of high call volumes, preventing users from gaming the system by sheer quantity.

So basically this formula keeps success rate important but rewards consistent contributors more.\
Also the log() function dampens the effect of total calls so that quality still matters.
