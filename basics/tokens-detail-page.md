# Token’s Detail Page

Each token on DYORHub has a dedicated detail page that brings together key information, on-chain data, community sentiment, and external resources — all in one place.&#x20;

Here's a breakdown of the main sections you'll find:

### 🔗 Social Links

This section aggregates verified links related to the token’s online presence — such as the official Twitter/X account, Telegram group, Discord server, or website. It helps you quickly evaluate the legitimacy and activity of the project’s social channels.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a Twitter/X account associated with the token has been **renamed in the past**, the icon next to it will appear in **red**. This indicates a change in the account’s identity. You can hover over the icon to **view the full history of previous account names**, helping you detect potential rebranding, misleading activity, or attempts to hide a past reputation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
By hovering your mouse over a project’s website link on DYORHub, you can view the **domain's expiration date**. This small detail can help you assess the **legitimacy and commitment** behind a project — newly registered or soon-to-expire domains may be a red flag, while long-term registrations often signal more serious intent.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If the token’s developer has verified ownership with DYORHub, you’ll see a badge that reads:\
&#xNAN;**“Dev verified: @handle”**

This badge confirms that the project’s creator has authenticated their identity and ownership via their Twitter/X account. You’ll also see a similar badge appear next to any comments made by the verified developer throughout the platform, so you can easily identify when the **real dev is speaking** — not just a random community member.

This helps bring more **transparency and trust** to the discussion around each token.

### 📊 Token Sentiment

An at-a-glance overview of community sentiment based on social data, mentions, and custom metrics. It gives you an idea of how the token is currently perceived — bullish, bearish or scam.

### 🧵 Bundle Analysis

The **Bundle Analysis** section helps you understand whether a token’s supply was **pre-consolidated in groups of wallets** (aka "bundles") and whether those tokens are still being held — a common tactic used in coordinated launches or potential rugs.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-05-04 at 16.30.25.png" alt="" width="343"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Powered by [**Trench.bot**](https://trench.bot), this tool reveals hidden wallet connections that could otherwise go unnoticed.

* **% Total Bundled**\
  The percentage of total token supply that was initially bundled across a group of linked wallets.
* **Currently Held % (Important)**\
  How much of the supply those bundled wallets still control _right now_. A value close to **0%** may indicate that tokens have been fairly distributed post-launch.
* **Total SOL Spent**\
  The total amount of SOL used by those bundled wallets when acquiring the token.
* **Total Bundles**\
  Number of unique bundle groups detected.
* **Bundled Wallets**\
  The total number of wallets that were part of those bundles.

If bundled wallets currently hold **0%** of the supply, the token is considered **"distributed"**, meaning those early buyers likely sold or distributed their holdings. This can be a sign of reduced centralization risk.

On the other hand, if bundled wallets still hold a **large share**, it could point to hidden whale control or future dump risk.
