# Referral

The DYORHub Referral Program lets you invite friends to join the platform and **earn recognition** for helping the community grow. Referrals are **tracked on your account**, contribute to the **leaderboard**, and may even be rewarded during **official contests**.

### **📤 Share Your Referral**

Under **Account → Referrals**, you’ll find a dedicated section with your:

* **Referral Code** (5 characters)
* **Referral Link** (auto-attaches your code)

You can share this link or code directly with friends, or post it on social media. Each person who signs up using it will count as **your referral**.

### ✅ Track Your Referrals

In the **“My Referrals”** tab, you’ll see a list of users who joined the platform using your code. This section will show the number of successful referrals you've made.

Your referral count directly contributes to the **Top Referrers Leaderboard**, helping you gain visibility and possibly win rewards in future campaigns.

### 🧾 Apply a Referral Code

If **you were referred by someone**, you can support them by entering their referral code in the **“Referred By”** tab. Just paste the 5-character code and click **“Apply Code.”**
