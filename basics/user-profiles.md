# User Profiles

Each DYORHub user has a **public profile page** where their activity, predictions, and on-chain reputation are transparently displayed. These profiles are designed to highlight users who consistently contribute valuable insights — and to let others engage, follow, and tip them.

You can view any user’s profile by clicking on the username or by visiting:\
`https://dyorhub.xyz/users/<username>`

* **Display Name & Handle**
