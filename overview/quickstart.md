# Team

**DYORHub** was created by **Julien Coulaud**, a fully **doxxed developer** ([https://x.com/JulienCoulaud](https://x.com/JulienCoulaud)) with a strong background in web and crypto technologies. From the start, the goal has been to build an open, transparent, and community-driven tool to make crypto research faster and safer — especially in the fast-moving world of Solana meme tokens.

While Julien leads the development, **DYORHub is open-source**, and a part of its evolution comes from the **community itself**. We actively encourage feedback, suggestions, and contributions from users.

#### 📌 How the Community Contributes

* **GitHub Issues**\
  We use GitHub to track feature requests, bug reports, and ideas. If you’ve got an improvement in mind or found a glitch, open an issue — or check existing ones to vote and comment.
* **🗣️ Active Discord Server**\
  Our Discord is where ideas flow. We’ve set up structured channels to collect feature suggestions, discuss use cases, and collaborate on roadmap priorities. It’s also a great place to connect with other users and help shape the platform.
* **🤝 Open Source Contributions**\
  Developers are welcome to contribute to the codebase. Transparency and collaboration are at the core of what we’re building.

Together, we're shaping DYORHub into the go-to research tool for degens who still care about data.
